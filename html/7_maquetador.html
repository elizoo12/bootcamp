  Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed!
  There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have
  you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
  smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
  Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions.
  
  No! Commence primary ignition. Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions
  of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better
  get on with your exercises.
  
  Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until
  you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right.
  Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted.

    Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed!
    There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have
    you been? They're heading in this direction.
    
    Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master
    Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.
    
    Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.
    You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a
    recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant
    old Ben.
    
    Yeah?This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! Hey, what're you trying to push on us? Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is
    in prime condition. A real bargain. Uncle Owen. Yeah? What about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that
    one. Yeah, take it away. Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.
    
    Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned
    ship right after takeoff.

    Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I
    don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are
    placed. I'm going back.
    
    There's something alive down there. Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are
    dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle.
    
    No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This
    signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie,
    let's check it out.
    
    There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah.
    
    Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.
    
    He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him.
    
    No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny.
    
    Han! Leia! Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw, I saw a city in the clouds.

    Captain. Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor
    wish to board immediately. Yes, yes, of course, as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to
    receive the Ambassador. I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.
    
    Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet. You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were
    short. Sir, a transmission from the planet.
    
    Careful, Ani, careful, Ani! That little human being is out of his mind. Punda tah punda! They're side by side! Bongo du
    bongu! Poodu! I can't believe it. The crowds are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah. Mom! I did it! Yeah! Great job, Ani! We owe
    you everything, Ani. It's so wonderful, Ani.
    
    fear leads to anger. anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.
    
    Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise put an end to corruption. Who else can be nominated? Bail Antilles of Alderaan
    and Ailee Teem of Malastare. I feel confident. our situation will create a strong sympathy vote for us.
    
    It deserves our gratitude. Continue, Captain. Your Highness, with your permission we're heading for a remote planet
    called Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation.
